To create binary file for running emulation, run "make".
For binary that will compare simulation and emulation results, run "make compare".
Before running the software, you must generate the input files by running "python coe_to_hex.py"
  This should create 27 files named phi(#).dat, one for each phi bin.
	This python script requires vcu118_input_patterns.coe as the input file.

To compare simulation and emulation results:
0. Run simulation in Vivado.
1. Run emulation by executing "./jet_find" (make sure all 27 input files exist in this directory)
2. Copy the simulation results to this directory (sim_outL2.txt).
3. Execute "./compare" (run "make compare" first if the "compare" binary doesn't already exist)
The results will be printed in the terminal and a jet-by-jet comparison will be in "matches.txt".


Add these changes:
Inputs: 27 phi sectors --> 9 phi sectors (phi sectors not the same as phi bins)
	Each phi sector will have one input for positive eta and one for negative eta
	24 --> 112 tracks/input_cable/event
	t input --> eta input (delete t to eta conversion in code in the .cpp file)
	change to new input track word (change which bits are assigned to which values) *look at picture in email*

For now, make the conversions listed above. i.e. do the first four changes.
in coe_to_hex.py, for the phi part of the given data, output the middle value of the phi sector in hexadecimal instead of the given phi value.
